What's the point of this code ?
-------------------------------
The code provided in this folder aims at training
neural network models on the data set provided for
the second Machine Learning project of the PCML
class. It heavily uses the Theano framework.

How can I run the code ?
------------------------
To run the code, you need a sufficiently recent version
of python 2, as well as some recent versions of numpy,
matplotlib and theano. For an easy tutorial on how to
install theano, you can check: 
http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html
The code in utils provides facilities to train various
models, and can be executed to train a simple MLP on the
dataset (provided you initially put the train folder in the
python folder). 
The code in cnn_learning enables you to train a Convolutional
Neural Network model on the CNN features provided. The same
prerequisites are to be fullfilled.
The code in generate_results is aim at providing predictions
for test data. The test.mat file must previously be placed into
the train folder, placed in the python folder, for the script to
run.
